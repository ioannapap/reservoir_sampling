Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry.
Anxiety can be either a short-term "state" or a long-term "trait".
The risk of anxiety leading to depression could possibly even lead to an individual harming themselves.
Humans generally require social acceptance.
Anxiety during social interactions, particularly between strangers, is common among young people.
Genetics and family history (e.g. parental anxiety) may put an individual at increased risk of an anxiety disorder.
Many studies in the past used a candidate gene approach to test whether single genes were associated with anxiety. 
These investigations were based on hypotheses about how certain known genes influence neurotransmitters.
Many medical conditions can cause anxiety.
Several drugs can cause or worsen anxiety, whether in intoxication, withdrawal or from chronic use.
An evolutionary psychology explanation is that increased anxiety serves the purpose of increased vigilance.
Anxiety is distinguished from fear, which is an appropriate cognitive and emotional response to a perceived threat.
